An old project from high school. A simple 2D platformer parkour game.
Co-author is Ramez Hatab. 

The objective is to jump from platform to platform to reach the right side of the screen. The obstacles are tiny rectangle bullets that, if the player is hit, 
flings the player based on their velocity.
